If a person needs to make a decision I can use machine learning to automate it or to present a restricted choice of options for the person to consider. 
machine learning uses examples to determine how to respond in a given situation. 
This allows it to be more flexible than rules-based systems. 
Instead of breaking when faced with a novel situation, machine learning simply makes a decision with a lower level of confidence.
