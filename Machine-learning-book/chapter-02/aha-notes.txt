## 1.Aha Note
Since 1970, business productivity in mature economies has barely moved, compared to the change in the processing power of computers. 
Over that period of time, business productivity has merely doubled, whereas the processing power of computers is 20 million times greater!

Solow Paradox
"You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics."

## 2. Aha Note
The reason automation is hard to implement is because, even though these processes look repetitive,
there are small decisions that need to be made at several steps along the way.

## 3. Aha Note
it’s easier to teach a person how to do a task than it is to program a computer with the rules required to perform the same task.


## 3. Aha Note
If a person needs to make a decision I can use machine learning to automate it or to present a restricted choice of options for the person to consider. 
machine learning uses examples to determine how to respond in a given situation. 
This allows it to be more flexible than rules-based systems. 
Instead of breaking when faced with a novel situation, machine learning simply makes a decision with a lower level of confidence.

## 4. Aha Note
ML can work only with numeric data.
```python
def to_sagemaker_csv(df, label_col, include_header=False):
    label = df[label_col].astype(int)
    feats = df.drop(columns=[label_col]).astype(float)  # <-- ADD .astype(float)
    out = pd.concat([label, feats], axis=1)
    return out.to_csv(None, header=include_header, index=False).encode('utf-8')
```
