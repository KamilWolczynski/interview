What I've done before an interview.
# Machine Learning for businesses 
Start 14-11-2025

I found out that it's a great opportunity to work with code, where I need to debug, understand, and see new solutions. The code is from 2020.

What did I learn today?
end-to-end systems, ex. ERP Enterprise Resource Planning

best-of-breed system --> a specialist

Automation is not the only way to become more productive. Before automating, you should ask whether you need to do the process at all. 
Can you create the required business value without automating?

awswrangler instead of s3fs should be the default toolkit when working towards AWS engineering. AWS Wrangler understands the entire AWS ecosystem

Concept drift --> input stays the same (same customers, same product categories, same features),
                  but the relationship between inputs and outputs changes (people used to buy more expensive items → now they switch to cheaper ones)
                  
every chapter is structure in the same way
Load and examine the data. 
Get the data into the right shape. 
Create training and validation datasets. 
Train the machine learning model. 
Host the machine learning model. 
Test the model and use it to make decisions.

Chapter 2,3,and 4 the machine learning algorithms arw supervised.
Chapter 5 uses unsupervised algorithm. Powerfull Random Cut Forest.
I don’t provide any labeled data. The algorithm decides self how to interpret the data.

**In business, the biggest enemy of supervised learning is lack of labeled data.**
