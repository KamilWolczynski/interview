What I've done before an interview.
# Machine Learning for businesses 
Start 14-11-2025

I found out that it's a great opportunity to work with code, where I need to debug, understand, and see new solutions.
With Grok's help, after a couple of hours, the second chapter exercise was completed successfully.

What did I learn today?
end-to-end systems, ex. ERP Enterprise Resource Planning

best-of-breed system --> a specialist

Automation is not the only way to become more productive. Before automating, you should ask whether you need to do the process at all. 
Can you create the required business value without automating?

awswrangler instead of s3fs should be the default toolkit when working towards AWS engineering. AWS Wrangler understands the entire AWS ecosystem

Concept drift --> input stays the same (same customers, same product categories, same features),
                  but the relationship between inputs and outputs changes (people used to buy more expensive items → now they switch to cheaper ones)
